- Logically, there is no reason for me to post this, except for several people who wanted me to post this, so "here we go again".

- This is not important anyway

Test:

```js
module.exports = {
  name: " ", // [1] command Name
  description: " ", // [2] command description
  global: false, // [3] Command (Guild/Global) (true = Global, flase = Guild)
  options: null, // [4] command Options
  async execute(client, interaction, args) {
    await interaction.reply({ content: " ", ephemeral: true }); // [5] Command replay
  }
};
```

- Best to use discord.js v13 or later

- It is better not to use node.js v12 or node.js v14, but rather use node.js v16.6.1 because you will not have any problems

- It is recommended to use the latest version of npm (v7.20.3) or later
